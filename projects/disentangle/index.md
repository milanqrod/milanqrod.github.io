In this blog, I’ll share updates on disentangling stellar parameters from spectra to learn a representation that emphasizes chemical composition. The main question I’m exploring is: can we learn a representation where a giant and a dwarf with the exact same chemistry end up close together in the learned space?

### Update 1- 27/02/2026
I start by building the baseline. I use a 1d CNN autoencoder architecture.
