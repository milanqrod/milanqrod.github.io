## Asteroideiak

This is the Asteroideiak project. We write a weekly article about any science topic we are curious about and want to share, and there’s only one rule: it has to be written in Basque.
Basque is a unique language, unrelated to any other in Europe, and as Basque-speaking scientists, this project is our way of making astronomy—and science in general—more accessible and engaging for the Basque-speaking community.
