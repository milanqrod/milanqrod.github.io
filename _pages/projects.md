This project focuses on identifying stellar streams in the Milky Way using Gaia data.  
The goal is to trace the galaxy’s accretion history and understand how these structures contribute to its evolution.

## Project 2: Spectroscopic Survey Analysis  
<img src="/assets/images/project2.jpg" width="300" align="right" style="margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:10px;"/>  
In this project, I analyze APOGEE and GALAH spectroscopic data to extract stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  
This helps us disentangle the formation history of the Galactic disk.
