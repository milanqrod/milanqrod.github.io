This paper explores the use  of Graph Neural Networks to jointly exploit chemical abundances and integrals-of-motion to do chemodynamical tagging in the Milky Way halo stars. In particular, we found that the results were much better when using layers with **attention mechanism**. This has a clear astrophysical explanation: the Lindblad diagram (energy $E$ vs. angular momentum $L_z$) is chemically heterogeneous, meaning stars that are close in dynamical space can have very different abundances.
Anyway, the most important result of this work is that accreted stars with close to zero net rotation show **bimodal chemistry**. On top of that, thay also have very different energy and $L_z$ distributions, which suggests that we are resolving the inner chemical structure of the GSE. What I like about this result is that it somehow allows us to somehow jump back in time, meaning, that if we interprete the metal poor, and chemically unevolve population as the outer layers and the metal rich, chemically mature group as the inner core, we can actually reconstruct the progenitor galaxy that was canibalized by the Milky Way 10 Gyrs ago! 
Of course, everyone might have their own interpretation. If you want to see the evidence for yourself, just click the link above.
