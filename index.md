Hi, I'm Milan! I'm a Ph.D. researcher at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) in Padova, where I apply data analysis techniques to process the vast amounts of data from large-scale stellar surveys and exploit them to their full potential. In 2024, I was fortunate to be awarded a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) fellowship as part of the recently established [EDUCADO Doctoral Network](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/educado/).  

My main scientific interest is our own galaxy, the Milky Way. More precisely, I aim to understand how it formed and evolved into what we observe today using surveys like Gaia, APOGEE, and GALAH. By identifying accreted substructures in its stellar halo and distinguishing them from stars born within the galaxy, I seek to reconstruct its assembly history.  

Outside of research, I enjoy trail running, biking, and listening to post-punk. Feel free to get in touch.
