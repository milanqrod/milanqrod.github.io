Hi, I'm Milan! I'm a Ph.D. student at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) in Padova, where I apply data analysis techniques to process the vast amounts of data from large-scale stellar surveys and exploit them to their full potential. In 2024, I was fortunate to be awarded a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) fellowship as part of the recently established [EDUCADO Doctoral Network](https://research.iac.es/proyecto/educado/).  

My main scientific interest is our own galaxy, the Milky Way. More precisely, I aim to understand how it formed and evolved into what we observe today using surveys like Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH (and hopefully soon WEAVE and 4MOST!)... by identifying it's building blocks, all the smaller galaxies that our Milky Way has canibalized during its lifetime, I seek to reconstruct its assembly history. I am very interested in connecting observational findings with theoretical works, so I try to answer the questions above by working somewhere in the intersection between these two.

I also really like machine learning. From unsupervised methods to deep learning techniques, I explore how these tools can help uncover hidden patterns in stellar populations. 

Outside of research, I enjoy trail running, biking, and listening to post-punk music. Feel free to get in touch.
